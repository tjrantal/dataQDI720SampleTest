Copied DataQ sample code for [DataQ developed network webpage](https://www.dataq.com/data-acquisition/software/developer-network/) sampling DataQ DI-720 USB A/D board on Windows 10. I have modified the code a little to confirm it works on the board I had but haven't indicated where I modified. This code is released into the public domain unless DataQ sample code mandates otherwise.
